Wha- What's happening? Is that a UFO outside?
Hello earthling, we're communicating through telepathy, we are inside your mind. I order you to come to the kitchen to receive our demands!

Alien (nach anklicken in KÃ¼che):
Hello lowly worker, we need your help. Bring us plutonium as fuel for our ship!
Otherwise we'll have to destroy your planet and use the force of the explosion to propel us into space to get to our home planet.
Make it quick, I'll give you until 12, or earth will be exterminated!

self(direkt danach): 
Oh god, what should I do? I remember that I can order plutonium on my PC, but I need the code from the safe in Big D's office to unlock it.

self(nach Plutonium Bestellung):
Now I can pick up the plutonium in the storage and bring it to the aliens in the kitchen.

Alien (nach anklicken mit Plutonium im Inventar):
Thank you earthling, but plutonium in it's raw form is useless for us. Please build us three fuel cores on the desk by assembling the raw plutonium into the given shape.
