Hi Jeremy,

this is your last working week after 40 years of hard labour for our nuclear power plant.
You always did an amazing job. I will miss you sincerely both as a colleague and a friend.

Remember that you can use the plan in the hallway if you're ever lost.
I will give you tasks that are shown on the right in your taskbar, you have to do them until you shift ends in the evening. Click on the eye in the upper right corner to show or hide your taskbar.

All endings are also a new beginning, I heard you will be going to Gran Canaria with Josephine. That's nice.
To a successful last week, old sport.

Best regards,
Big D
