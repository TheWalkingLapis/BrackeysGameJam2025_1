Hi Jeremy,

this is your last working week after 40 years of hard labour for our nuclear power plant.
You always did an amazing job. I will miss you sincerely both as a colleague and a friend.

All endings are also a new beginning, I heard you will be going to Gran Canaria with Josephine. That's nice.
To a successful last week, old sport.

Best regards,
Big D
