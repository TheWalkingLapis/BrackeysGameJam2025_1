Hi Jeremy,

maybe you've already heard, but there's a pandemic going around. 
Our janitor Fernando and Fred from logistics both called in sick today. Could you please help out and also do their work?

Fernando as a janitor always watered the plant in your office and in the hallway. This should be easy, there's a watering can in the kitchen. He also reconnected the circuits in the power boxes when they were broken. You can do this by simply wiring the matching colors.

You have to do a little bit of walking for Fred's logistics tasks. He delivered everything Sophia ordered to it's place. This should be straightforward, just collect the things you've ordered in the storage and put them to the right place.

To do all of this, you can now access the kitchen, storage and the passage to the reactor.

Thank you Jeremy.

Best regards,
Big D
