Hi Jeremy,

apparently there's aliens visiting us on earth and everyone's going crazy?
Our government ordered us to mass-produce atom bombs now?!

I know you have a lot on your plate already but you have to do this as well, no one else can do it.
I have the assembly manual here, it should be as follows:
You have to order uranium and a atom bomb kit from your PC, go to the storage and put both those things on the workbench.
Then assemble the bomb by simply picking up the pieces and putting them to the right space.

I'm starting to get sick too, I have a really bad cough. If I continue to get sicker at this rate, I won't be able to come in tomorrow.
Just to remind you, in case of an emergency, if you have to unlock the plutonium in the shop, the code is in the safe in my office.

The future of our nation depends on you! You can do this!

Best regards,
Big D
